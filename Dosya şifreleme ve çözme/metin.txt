A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer 
programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers
to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and 
peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a 
group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices
like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose
devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of
millions of other computers and their users.

Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in
doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding
patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital
electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by 
the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the
microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing
dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital
Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a
microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out
arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information.
Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and
input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved
from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
